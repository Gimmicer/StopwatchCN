# StopwatchCN
A simple stopwatch project for Coding Ninja.
# Here is the link to access the code https://github.com/Gimmicer/StopwatchCN.git

In this project the main function is stopwath() , this function is handeling the time of count(miliseconds), I used setTimeout function,only the logic is if we want count 100 then how we manage the 1000 miliseconds, so i did 1000/100 = 10, so i used 10 in second perameter of setTimeout function,and other are if,elseif and else conditions are used,like if the count is 100 then seconds will increased by 1 and reset the count,elseif seconds is 60 then minutes is increase by 1 and reset the seconds,elseif minute is 60 then hour is increase by 1 and reset the minutes and seconds at 0.
